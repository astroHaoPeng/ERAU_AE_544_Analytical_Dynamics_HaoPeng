# AE 544 Analytical Dynamics

## Disclaimers
This repository contains markdown-based lecture notes for the Spring 2025 semester. These materials are intended solely for students enrolled in the course during this term. Mistakes may exist and will be corrected as they are identified, but the official textbook remains the ultimate reference for accuracy.

## Obsidian Markdown Notes
This public repo contains the lecture notes written in Obsidian Markdown (https://obsidian.md/), including all the plugins and configurations files for the Obsidian vault.

## How to use GitHub and Git
Here is a brief tutorial from my lab: https://alpenglow.space/kb/pvt-lab-tutorials/git

After you **clone** the repo and open its root folder as a vault in Obsidian, you should have all the plugins and configurations set up correct. 
If not, you may have opened a wrong directory.

### Why GitKraken? 
With GitKraken, you will be able to merge your local changes (if any) to notes and my changes to the notes in an easier manner.

GitKraken Pro is available once you registered GitHub Education Package. Check my lab tutorial above.
